## About

The Food Recipe App allows users to browse a variety of recipes, view full recipe details (ingredients, instructions, images), and search for recipes by name or category. Itâ€™s a clean, beginner-friendly project aimed at demonstrating front-end development, API integration, and responsive design.

## Features

- Browse a list/grid of recipes  
- Search for recipes by keyword or filter by category  
- View recipe details: title, image, ingredients, instructions  
- Responsive design (desktop & mobile)  
- API integration (e.g., using the Spoonacular recipes API)  
- Clean UI with intuitive user experience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)  
- npm (or yarn)  

Optionally:

- A free API key from Spoonacular (or whichever recipe API youâ€™re using)  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WaruniGunasena/Food-Recipe-App.git
   cd Food-Recipe-App
````

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file (if required) and add your API key

   ```
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Start the development server

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port your setup uses)
````
## Usage

* On the main page youâ€™ll see a list of recipes.
* Use the search bar (or filter) to find a recipe by name or category.
* Click on a recipe card/image to view its detailed page (title, big image, ingredients list, cooking instructions).
* On mobile, the layout adjusts to fit smaller screens.

## Technologies

* React (hooks)
* React Router (if used)
* CSS / SCSS or Styled-Components
* Fetch API / Axios for HTTP requests
* Responsive design (Flexbox/Grid)
* Recipe API (Spoonacular or similar)

## Future Improvements

Here are some ideas to enhance the app:

* Add user authentication (login/signup) and ability to save favorite recipes
* Add categories/tags & filtering (e.g., vegan, gluten-free)
* Add pagination or infinite scroll for large result sets
* Improve UI/UX: animations, dark mode toggle, skeleton loaders
* Add recipe upload (if backend implemented)
* Add tests (unit + integration)
* Convert to a full-stack app: backend (Node.js/Express) + database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL) + deploy

**Enjoy building and refining your Food Recipe App!**
If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue.

### âœ… What you should do next:
- Capture a screenshot of your app and save it under a folder like `screenshots/`.  
- If you havenâ€™t already, create a `.env` (or similar) for your API key and `.gitignore` it.  
- Update any placeholder details above (like tech stack specifics, API details).  
- Add optional badges at the top (build status, coverage, version) if you set up CI or testing.

If you like, I can **generate a badge section** (shields.io) and **help you craft a screenshot placeholder** for your README. Would you like me to do that?
